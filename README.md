# 🌱 GreenBridge

GreenBridge is a role-based sustainability and ecological governance platform that connects business partners and government authorities to enable transparent land utilization, ecological restoration, and verified environmental impact.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

Large areas of land are degraded or underutilized.

Companies want to invest in sustainability but face:

- Lack of transparency  
- Unverified impact claims  
- Complex approval processes  

Government bodies struggle with:

- Manual workflows  
- Poor monitoring  
- Limited analytics and reporting  

❗ No unified system exists to connect industry + governance + land data.
