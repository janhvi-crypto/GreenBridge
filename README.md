#🌱 GreenBridge#

GreenBridge is a role-based sustainability platform that connects companies, government bodies, and citizens to enable transparent, verified ecological restoration and responsible land utilization.

It acts as a digital bridge between land, industry, and governance—turning sustainability goals into measurable, auditable impact.

🚨 Problem Statement

Large areas of land remain degraded or underutilized

Companies want to meet ESG & sustainability goals, but face:

Fragmented data

Lack of verification

Greenwashing risks

Government bodies struggle with:

Manual approval workflows

Poor visibility into land usage

Limited post-approval monitoring

Citizens lack trust and access to verified green initiatives

💡 Solution: GreenBridge

GreenBridge provides a centralized, role-based platform that enables:

Structured ecological project requests by companies

Transparent approvals and compliance tracking by government bodies

Data-driven monitoring of environmental impact

A future-ready marketplace for citizen participation

🧩 Platform Architecture

GreenBridge is built around three core dashboards:

1️⃣ Partner (Company) Dashboard

For businesses and organizations

Features:

Submit ecological / land restoration requests

Access a B2B2C sustainability marketplace

Matching engine for projects & resources

ROI & impact calculators

Order and compliance management

Impact analytics dashboard

2️⃣ Government Dashboard

For municipalities and regulatory authorities

Features:

Centralized overview of all projects

Inventory & land management

3️⃣ Consumer Marketplace (Planned)

🔐 Role-Based Access Control

GreenBridge uses authentication + role separation to ensure:

Each role sees only what they are authorized to see

This ensures security, accountability, and trust.
